Hey

Follow along as I complete a full review of the Automate the Boring Stuff with Python book. 

I plan to do this because I've always wanted to finish this book, and better understand Python. 
TOOLS: :)
File Type: M.Word (Some notes will be stored in Obsidian as well)
Notes: I will take handwritten notes for each of the chapters in the book.
      e-notes within the M.Word document will be included as well. 


I plan to complete this before the end of December and post as much content once or twice a week.
